## Overview 

SocialSent is a package for inducing and analyzing domain-specific sentiment lexicons.
A number of state-of-the-art algorithms are included, including SentProp and Densifier (http://www.cis.lmu.de/~sascha/Ultradense/).
A detailed description of the algorithms in the SocialSent package, with references, is provided in the paper:
[Inducing Domain-Specific Sentiment Lexicons from Unlabeled Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02820).

The [project website](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/socialsent) includes pre-constructed sentiment lexicons for 150 years of historical English and 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit.
